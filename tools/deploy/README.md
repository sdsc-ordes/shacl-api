# kubernetes Manifests

Manifests in this directory are templated with ytt.

## How to use

To render these manifests in your own deployment repository, you could import them with [`vendir`](https://carvel.dev/vendir/) and render them with your [custom values](https://carvel.dev/ytt/docs/v0.51.0/ytt-data-values/).
